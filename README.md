# Recommendation_Concentration
Research project focusing on how yelp reviews effect firm concentration in cities across the United States.

json2csv provides the code that I used to export the json code provided by yelp.com, and the extraction process to get the data as a workable csv file.

Once a csv file was created, I created a new notebook, yelp_data_eda to where I explored what exactly was contained within the data. Here, I discovered the main cities, being Santa Barbra, Reno, Tucson, Boise, Edmonton, Illinois suburbs of St Louis, Indianapolis, Nashville, Tampa, Philly and New Orleans. After this, I explored different categories that businessses were listed as. Finally, I created a pivot table, which summed the amount of each star rating each business had, every year. This is the main result from this program.

By creating this pivot table, I can start to test my hypothesis.
